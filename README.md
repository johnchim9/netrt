- You can start and stop the listener (at will)
- Beautiful user interface


> We have deleted ngrok in the new version of storm breaker and entrusted the user with run and share the localhost. So please note that storm breaker runs a localhost for you and you have to start the ngrok on your intended port yourself.

#### Attention!:
> This version can be run both on local host and on your personal domain and host. In any case, you can use it for both situations. If your country has filtered the ngrok service, or your country has banned ngrok, or your victim cannot open the ngrok link (for the reasons that he sees such a link as suspicious, or if this service is filtered in his country), we suggest. The use of the tool is on personal hosting and domain

### how to run personal host


```bash
Zip the contents of the storm-web folder completely and upload it to the public_html path


Note that the tool should not be opened in such a path > yourdomain.com/st-web

Rather, it should be opened purely in the public_html path (i.e., don't just zip the storm-web folder itself, but manually zip its contents (the index.php file and other belongings should be in the public_html path)
```
